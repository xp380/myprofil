            <br></br>
            <p>After the highschool, i started my job as an accountant in several companies. I worked for a short time. But i realised that it wasn't my vocation. I decided to change path to be a fullstack developer. Thanks to my brother who is already a front end developer. My favorite language is react js. But i want to improve my skills on the node js. <br></br> Actually, i am looking for a study contract for november 2020. I can also start in september or october. But My formation starts in the beginning of november.
